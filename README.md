## Byteball Backups and Recovery

Byteball uses a single extended private key for all wallets, BIP44 is used for wallet address derivation.  There is a BIP39 mnemonic for backing up the wallet key, but it is not enough.  Private payments and co-signers of multisig wallets are stored only in the app's data directory, which you have to back up manually:

* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/byteball`
* Linux: `~/.config/byteball`
* Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\byteball`
